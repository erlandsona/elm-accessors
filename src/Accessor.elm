{-| Relations are interfaces to document the relation between two data
structures. For convenience, we'll call the containing structure `super`, and
the contained structure `sub`. What a `Relation` claims is that a `super` is
referencing a `sub` in some way.

Relations are the building blocks of accessors. An accessor is a function that
expects a `Relation` and builds a new relation with it. Accessors are
composable, which means you can build a chain of relations to manipulate nested
structures without handling the packing and the unpacking.

{-| This is an approximation of Van Laarhoven encoded lenses which enable the
the callers to use regular function composition to build more complex nested
updates of more complicated types.

The original "Lens" type looked more like

    type alias Lens structure focus =
        { access : structure -> focus
        , set : structure -> focus -> structure
        }

Unfortunately, these can't be composed without
defining custom `composeLens`, `composeIso`, `composePrism` functions.

With this approach we're able to make use of `<<`
to [`access`](#access)/[`map`](#map) deeply nested data.

{-| A `Relation super sub wrap` is a type describing how to interact with a
`sub` data when given a `super` data.

The `wrap` exists because some types can't ensure that `access` will return a
`sub`. For instance, `Maybe sub` may not actually contain a `sub`. Therefore,
`access` returns a `wrap` which, in that example, will be `Maybe sub`

Implementation: A relation is a banal record storing a `access` function and an
`map` function.

{-| Lazy versions of [`map`](#map).

These actions check that the old and the new version are different before writing.
They are useful when used together with `Html.lazy`, because it uses reference
equality for complex structures. Therefore, using lazy `map` will
not prevent `Html.lazy` from doing its work.

The map function takes:

  - An accessor,
  - A function `(sub -> sub)`,
  - A datastructure with type `super`

and it returns the data structure, with the accessible field changed by applying
the function to the existing value.
The structure is changed only if the new field is different from the old one.
