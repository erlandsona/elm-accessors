{-| Relations are interfaces to document the relation between two data
structures. For convenience, we'll call the containing structure `super`, and
the contained structure `sub`. What a `Relation` claims is that a `super` is
referencing a `sub` in some way.

Relations are the building blocks of accessors. An accessor is a function that
expects a `Relation` and builds a new relation with it. Accessors are
composable, which means you can build a chain of relations to manipulate nested
structures without handling the packing and the unpacking.

{-| Intuitively, a "Lens" type could look like

    type alias Lens structure focus =
        { view : structure -> focus
        , replace : focus -> (structure -> structure)
        }

Unfortunately, we then need `composeLens`, `composeIso`, `composePrism` functions.

With this approach we're able to make use of `>>`
to [`view`](#view)/[`map`](#map) a nested structure.

Technical note: This is an approximation of [Van Laarhoven encoded lenses](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-05-05-existential-optics/).

{-| A `Relation structure focus accessible` describes how to interact with a
`focus` when given a `structure`.

Sometimes, `view` can't return a `focus`
For instance, `List focus` may not actually contain 1 `focus`.
Therefore, `accessible` can be a simple wrapper which, in that example, will be `List focus`
